# ONE-PAGE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
## HerBlock - Blockchain Herb Traceability Partnership

---

## THE PROBLEM

**30-40% of Ayurvedic products** contain adulterated herbs. Indian herbal exports face **₹2,000+ Cr annual rejections** due to lack of source verification. Consumers cannot verify if "Himalayan" herbs actually came from the Himalayas.

---

## OUR SOLUTION

**HerBlock** is a blockchain-based traceability system that validates the **GPS location of herb collection** at the blockchain level before any data is recorded. If a collector tries to claim herbs from an unauthorized location, the **blockchain itself rejects the transaction**.

---

## KEY INNOVATION (PATENT PENDING)

| Other Solutions | HerBlock |
|----------------|----------|
| App validates GPS, then sends to blockchain | **Blockchain validates GPS inside smart contract** |
| Can be hacked/bypassed | **Cannot be bypassed - mathematical proof** |
| Trust the software | **Trust the consensus** |

**Technical:** Haversine formula executed at blockchain consensus level for geographic origin validation.
