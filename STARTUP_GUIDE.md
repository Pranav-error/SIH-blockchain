## 📝 COLLEGE IPR CELL DISCUSSION POINTS

### What to Discuss

1. **IP Ownership Agreement**
   - Who owns the patent? (You vs College vs Joint)
   - Revenue sharing if college claims partial ownership
   - Typical: Student keeps IP, college gets acknowledgment + small royalty

2. **Incubation Support**
   - Does college have an incubator?
   - Can they provide seed funding?
   - Office space / infrastructure?

3. **Mentorship**
   - Faculty advisor for technical guidance
   - Industry connections
   - Patent attorney referrals

4. **Filing Support**
   - Does college cover patent filing costs?
   - Legal assistance for drafting
   - Prior art search help

### Sample Agreement Terms

| Term | Favorable for You | Typical College Ask |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| IP Ownership | 100% yours | Joint ownership |
| Royalty to College | 0-2% of revenue | 5-10% of revenue |
| Acknowledgment | In publications | Logo usage rights |
| First Refusal | None | Investment rights |

**Negotiation Tip**: If you developed this independently (not as part of coursework/thesis), you have stronger claim to 100% ownership.

Subject: Request for Patent Filing Support - Blockchain-Based Herb Traceability System

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am [Your Name], a student of [Department] at [College Name], Enrollment No: [XXXXX].

I have developed a novel blockchain-based system for authenticating Ayurvedic herbs

Hackathon 2024-25.

Key Innovation:
- First system to validate herb collection GPS coordinates ON-CHAIN using Hyperledger Fabric
- Prevents origin fraud at the blockchain consensus level
- Applicable to India's ₹50,000 crore Ayurvedic industry

I request the IPR Cell's support for:
1. Preliminary review of the technical abstract (attached)
2. Guidance on patent filing process
3. Clarification on IP ownership policy for student innovations
4. Connection with patent attorneys if available

I am available for a meeting at your convenience to demonstrate the working system.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
