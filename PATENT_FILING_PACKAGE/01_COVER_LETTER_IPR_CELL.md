**Subject:** Request for Patent Filing Support - Blockchain-Based Herb Traceability System with On-Chain GPS Geo-Fence Validation and Multi-Organization Consensus

---

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to seek the support of the REVA University IPR Cell for filing a patent application for an invention I have developed as part of my academic and innovation activities.

## About the Invention

**Title:** "Consensus-Level Geographic Origin Validation System for Ayurvedic Herb Supply Chain Traceability Using Permissioned Blockchain with Embedded Haversine-Based GPS Geo-Fence Validation, Dynamic Regulatory Zone Governance, Multi-Organization Endorsement, and Cryptographic Identity Binding"

**Short Title (for reference):** "HerBlock - Blockchain GPS-Validated Herb Traceability System"

**Summary:** I have developed a novel blockchain-based system that validates the geographical origin of Ayurvedic medicinal herbs using GPS geo-fence technology integrated with Hyperledger Fabric distributed ledger. The key innovation is that GPS validation happens **on-chain** (within the blockchain smart contract) rather than as a pre-processing step, making it impossible to bypass.

**Problem Addressed:** 30-40% of Ayurvedic products in India contain adulterated or substituted herbs from unauthorized locations, causing health risks and export rejections worth ₹2,000+ crore annually.

**Innovation:** This is the **first system** that validates herb collection GPS coordinates at the blockchain consensus level before committing data to the immutable ledger.

## Key Innovations (Multiple Patentable Features)

| # | Innovation | Technical Detail |
|---|------------|------------------|
| 1 | **On-Chain GPS Validation** | GPS coordinates validated INSIDE blockchain smart contract, not in app/backend - impossible to bypass |
| 2 | **Haversine Distance Computation** | Spherical geometry formula (d = r × Δσ) executed on-chain with explicit mathematical threshold |
| 3 | **Dynamic Zone Governance** | Collection zones stored as ledger state assets, updatable by regulators without code redeployment |
| 4 | **Multi-Organization Consensus** | Both Government (Org1) and Industry (Org2) must validate every transaction |
| 5 | **Cryptographic Identity Binding** | Collector GPS submissions bound to X.509 certificates via Membership Service Provider (MSP) |
| 6 | **Species-Specific Geo-Fencing** | Different validation zones for different herbs based on AYUSH/NMPB guidelines |
| 7 | **Complete Supply Chain Traceability** | Collection → Processing → Quality Testing → Final Product, all on-chain |
| 8 | **Consumer QR Verification** | Serialized QR codes link to full provenance bundle, scannable by consumers |

## Request to IPR Cell

I kindly request your support for:

1. **Preliminary Review** of the attached technical abstract and documentation
2. **Guidance** on the patent filing process under Indian Patent Act, 1970
3. **Clarification** on IP ownership policy for student innovations at REVA
4. **Connection** to empaneled patent attorneys, if available
5. **Funding Support** for filing fees, if applicable under any university scheme

## Attachments

1. **Technical Abstract** (PATENT_TECHNICAL_ABSTRACT.md) - Detailed invention description
2. **Form 1** (Application for Patent) - Draft filled
3. **Form 2** (Provisional Specification) - Technical specification
4. **Form 28** (Statement for Startup/Student fee concession)
5. **Project Summary** - Overview document
6. **Working Demo** - Can be demonstrated upon request

## IP Ownership Proposal

I understand that REVA University may have policies regarding IP created by students. I am open to discussing:
- University as **Applicant** with me as **Inventor** (preferred, if university covers fees)
- Joint ownership with agreed revenue sharing
- Student retains full ownership with university acknowledgment

## Urgency

I request an early meeting as I wish to secure a **priority date** before any public disclosure of this innovation. The provisional patent application can be filed within ₹1,600 (student fee) to lock in the invention date.

## Availability

I am available for a meeting and live demonstration at your convenience. I can show the working Hyperledger Fabric blockchain system with GPS validation functioning in real-time.

Thank you for your time and support. I look forward to your guidance.
