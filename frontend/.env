REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000


### **Let's Do a Full Reset and Run**

To make sure everything is correct and we don't miss any steps, please follow this checklist precisely.

1.  **Confirm File Structure:** Make sure your files are in the `src` folder and `app.js` has been renamed to `App.js`.
    ```
    frontend/
    └── src/
        ├── App.js      <-- Capital A
        ├── app.css
        ├── components/
        ├── index.css
        └── index.js
    ```

2.  **Confirm `index.js` is correct:** Make sure your `frontend/src/index.js` file is pointing to the capitalized `App.js`. I am providing the corrected file here again just to be certain.

3.  **Run Both Servers (in the correct order):**

    * **Open Terminal Window 1 (for the Backend):**
        ```bash
        # Navigate to the backend folder
        cd /Users/saipranav/Desktop/app/backend

        # Start the Python server
        uvicorn server:app --reload
                You should see a message saying the server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

    * **Open Terminal Window 2 (for the Frontend):**
        ```bash
        # Navigate to the frontend folder
        cd /Users/saipranav/Desktop/app/frontend

        # Stop the old server if it's running (Ctrl + C)
        # Start the server again
        yarn start
                The new `.env` file will now be loaded correctly.

Your browser should open to `localhost:3000` and your application should now appear.

**If it is still a blank page:** Please open the developer console (Right-click -> Inspect -> Console) and tell me what the error message in red text says. That will be the final clue.
